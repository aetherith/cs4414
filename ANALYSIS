2:  No there is no danger of these two processes interfering with eachother. The
    parent process is set to wait until the child has exited before continuing 
    its own operations since the new shell was started in the foreground.
    When the child exits it cleans up all of its file handles and associated
    memory so that there is nothing left over for the parent to interact with.
    Upon returning to the parent process, the parent reaps the child's entry
    out of the process table and then continues its own operation.

3: If the shell exits while there are still background processes running, those
   processes become orphans and are adoped by the init process.  It will occasionally
   run wait() to reap completed processes out of the process table.  If the user wants
   to know what background processes are still running they can execute ps -uf to
   generate a table similar to the one shown for #1.

4: Book #3.5
   After a fork the parent and child processes share stack and heap contents as well
   as any open file handles.  They do not however share any memory segments as when
   fork is called a complete and unique copy of the parent's address space is created
   for the child process.

5: Book #3.9
   When the kernel performs a context switch it takes the current state of the CPU
   (PC, registers, etc.) and stores them in the PCB of the process that is being switched
   out.  Then the PCB of the process being switched in is loaded into the CPU returning it
   to the last state it held during the switched in process.  Some CPUs may also have 
   multiple register sets to reduce the time required to context switch by simply changing
   the pointer to the current working set of registers.

   A total of  16 processes are created.

8: Additonal Assumptions
   * Only the input or the output may be redirected from a command in a single line.  If a second redirect operator is applied then it and its operands are ignored.
   * Background processes should not suppress STDERR, only STDOUT, as the user should be alerted if there are errors in their background processes.
