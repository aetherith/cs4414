Inodes Vs. Blocks

In I/O, inodes are contained in blocks. inode basically describes an indifidual file in a file system.
It contains information about the file like extension, permission and such related metadata. The rest 
of a file system are called the data blocks and this is the place where the actual data is stored. There 
are 2048 addresseable blocks. And we can get to this from a 32 bit, which is 4 bytes so if we divide the 
block size (8192) by 4, we get that number 2048.
